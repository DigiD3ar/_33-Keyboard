This is the STL for the _33 keyboard designed by tominabox1 (discord @tominabox1#7884). The USB cutout may be too small on the normal model, it measures approximately 11x5.5mm.  The "big USB" version is approximately 13.3mmx8mm but impacts the chamfer design. 

Recommend printing with top parallel to bed. Be sure to use a support interface (roof), raft optional.
